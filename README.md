<h2  align="center">Data visualization project</h2>

  


The project consists in the creation of some interesting and appealing visualizations that tell a story; the chosen subject was the Sanremo Festival, the most important Italian music competition that takes place every year.

The data was downloaded using the spotify APIs and scraping some web pages to retrieve information about the artists. The plots were created using the Tableau software.

To produce a better result we created a web page that describes in detail all the steps required to create the dataset and some considerations about the visualizations. Also, a section of user tests has been added to understand the interpretability of the plots. You can check out the web page here: [Non solo leggerissima](https://andreamaver.github.io/DataVisualization/).

The page is available in Italian only.
